The latest version (v4.0.0) of GUI from TI has some errors. To use this GUI in Linux
some parts of the codes need to be corrected. The source code can be obtained
from GUI file for Windows. There is [Source Code] folder.

Tested on XPS9300, Linux 18.04.4 LTS (kernel 5.0.0), DLPLCR4500 (v4.0.0), DLPR350PROM (v4.1.0)
Qt Creator 4.5.2 based on Qt 5.9.5

------


1. Directory path [LCr4500.pro] should be updated.

From
#win32:CONFIG(release, debug|release): LIBS += -L../GUI/hidapi-master/windows/release/ -lhidapi
#else:win32:CONFIG(debug, debug|release): LIBS += -L../GUI/hidapi-master/windows/debug/ -lhidapi
#macx: SOURCES += ../GUI/hidapi-master/mac/hid.c
#unix: !macx: SOURCES += ../GUI/hidapi-master/linux/hid.c

To
win32:CONFIG(release, debug|release): LIBS += -L../hidapi-master/windows/release/ -lhidapi
else:win32:CONFIG(debug, debug|release): LIBS += -L../hidapi-master/windows/debug/ -lhidapi
macx: SOURCES += hidapi-master/mac/hid.c
unix: !macx: SOURCES += hidapi-master/linux/hid.c


From
#INCLUDEPATH += ../GUI/hidapi-master/hidapi
#DEPENDPATH += ../GUI/hidapi-master/hidapi

To
INCLUDEPATH += hidapi-master/hidapi
DEPENDPATH += hidapi-master/hidapi



2. Some definition of [dlpc350_firmware.cpp] should be corrected.
The indent should be inserted appropriately.

#ifdef _WIN32
    #include <windows.h>
#else
    typedef unsigned short WORD;
    typedef unsigned int LONG;
    typedef unsigned int DWORD;
    typedef struct tagBITMAPFILEHEADER {
        WORD bfType;
        DWORD bfSize;
        WORD bfReserved1;
        WORD bfReserved2;
        DWORD bfOffBits;
    } BITMAPFILEHEADER, *PBITMAPFILEHEADER;
    typedef struct tagBITMAPINFOHEADER {
        DWORD biSize;
        LONG  biWidth;
        LONG  biHeight;
        WORD  biPlanes;
        WORD  biBitCount;
        DWORD biCompression;
        DWORD biSizeImage;
        LONG  biXPelsPerMeter;
        LONG  biYPelsPerMeter;
        DWORD biClrUsed;
        DWORD biClrImportant;
    } BITMAPINFOHEADER, *PBITMAPINFOHEADER;
#endif



3. Update the package manager and install required packages.

$sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

$sudo apt install build-essential

$sudo apt install qtcreator qt5-default



4. Compile the source code. [cd] to the directory including [LCr4500.pro] file.

$qmake LCr4500.pro

$make

[LightCrafter4500] is newly made if compiled successfully (green color in
terminal). Sometimes $make shows errors even if $qmake works. In this case,
edit [LCr4500.pro] file ...



5. Another package is needed to communiate via usb, [libudev-dev].

$sudo apt install libudev-dev



6. After successfully compiling the Qt project and installing packages, connect
the Lightcrafter4500 to computer via USB.



7. To communicate with the device with non-superuser account, make a file in
/etc/udev/rules.d/

$cd /etc/udec/rules.d/

make a file and edit. For example,

$sudo vim 10-lightcrafter.rules

add below to the file.

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ACTION=="add", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0451",
ATTRS{idProduct}=="6401", GROUP=="dlee"

(The vendor id and product id can be found by $lsusb command. Put your user id
into the GROUP=="___")




8. Reboot your system.




9. [cd] to the directory with [LightCrafter4500] file. Execute this file.

$./LightCrafter4500



10. When connection bullet changes from red to green, then it's connected!



11. (However, the firmware update of [DLPC350] chipset was not possible -
currently v.4.1.0. You can try to upload the firmware using another USB
packages. Another option would be update the firmware using Windows machine
first, and then operate the Lightcrafter4500 in Linux.


12. Check if stimulus (Psychtoolbox-3) works well with the Lightcrafter4500.



13. Done. Good luck!!
